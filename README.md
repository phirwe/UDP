PART 1
The two files are udp_client.c and udp_server.c located in their own folders called Client and Server.

They each have their own makefile, hence to compile, go into each folder and use the command 'make'

The format to run executables is as follows:

1. ./server <port> <name of raw file>
2. ./client <server-ip> <port> <name of raw file>

The timings Ti-3, Ti-2, Ti-1, Ti are stored as T0, T1, T2, T3 respectively
with T0 and T1 in the server and T2 and T3 in the client.

PART 2
The Python code to execute the plots are located in a Plots.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. In order to run the notebook, go into the terminal and run the command 'jupyter notebook'

Alternately, the Plots.py file can be run.

PART 3
The raw files are located as .csv files from server and client respectively.
